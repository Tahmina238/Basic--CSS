        <p style="font-style: italic;">A "stack developer" typically refers to a software developer who is proficient in
          working with the technologies that make up a software stack. A software stack is a collection of software
          tools and technologies used to develop a particular type of software application.
          The specific technologies and tools that a stack developer works with can vary depending on the requirements
          of the project, but commonly include:Frontend technologies: These are the technologies used to develop the
          user interface of a web application. This may include HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as frontend
          frameworks like React.js, AngularJS, or Vue.js.These are the technologies used to develop the server-side
          logic and database interactions of a web application. Common backend technologies include programming
          languages like JavaScript (Node.js), Python (Django, Flask), Ruby (Ruby on Rails), Java (Spring Boot), or PHP
          (Laravel), as well as databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, or SQLite.</p>

      <p style="font-style: italic;">I'm looking to set some long term goals now. I realised I'm being sidetracked by
        all the different technologies coming out and I really want to settle down and focus on one thing. I believe
        setting a definite goal will help me achieve that. I know goals are personal and unique, but I'm sure I can
        get some inspiration from someone.Also My goal is to be a passionate inspiring and creative developer that
        will be able to invent and innovate; also share and teach others in a way that they can be excited like I am
        about programming. Last but not least be a competent freelancer.Originally, I planned to focus solely on
        business marketing because there were not many digital marketing degrees available. Over the last two years
        though, several schools throughout the country have developed internet marketing courses that explain
        fundamental methods of search engine optimization, website analytics, and more. These are the foundations I
        will build my career around. </p><br>
